This application provides the predicted amount of roof leakage incidents 
for the next 5 working days. Since the client covers mainly North Holland, 
it was decided to make two separate models for the Schiphol area and the whole Netherlands.

### info

- the first 2 days' predictions use Harmonie predicted weather, while the rest use GFS predicted weather (less accurate). Hence, they are shown in blue and grey
- predictions were scheduled for daily update
- the app was deployed in RShiny 
- a performance graph is included for monitoring
