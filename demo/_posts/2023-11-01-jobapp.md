### functionalities

- the main menu is opened when the app starts, which allows the user to (1) enter or edit current job details, (2) enter job offers, (3) adjust the comparison settings, or (4) compare job offers (disabled if no job offers were entered yet)
- when choosing to enter current job details, a user will be shown a user interface to enter (if it is the first time) or edit all the details of their current job, which consist of:
    * Title
    * Company
    * Location (entered as city and state)
    * Cost of living in the location (expressed as an index)
    * Yearly salary
    * Yearly bonus
    * Gym Membership
    * Leave time (in days)
    * 401K Match (0-20 inclusive, expressed as a whole percent)
    * Pet Insurance ($0 to $5,000 inclusive annually)
- the above interface is also used when the user choose to enter new offer. After finishing, the user can choose to enter another offer, go back to menu or compare with current job
- when choosing to compare job offers, a user will be shown a list of job offers, displayed as Title and Company, ranked from best to worst, and including the current job (if present), clearly indicated.
For ranking, a jobâ€™s score is computed as:

`AYS + AYB + GYM + (LT * AYS / 260) + (AYS * 401K / 100 ) + PET`

    * `AYS` = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living 
    * `AYB` = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living 
    * `GYM` = Gym Membership Allowance ($0 to $500 annually) 
    * `LT` = leave time 
    * `401K` = % 401K Match 
    * `PET` = Pet Insurance
- the comparison screen displays details of the selected jobs side-by-side
