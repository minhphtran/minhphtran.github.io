This app attempts to scrape the first 150 cars (of the chosen brand and type) that are sold on Marktplaats.
It provides a simple example of how unstructured data can be extracted and visualised in order to 
gather information. 

The app bears no malicious intent. It serves educational purposes ([Novalinq academy](https://www.novalinq.nl/academy){:target="_blank"}) 
and certain individuals' burning passion for cars.
