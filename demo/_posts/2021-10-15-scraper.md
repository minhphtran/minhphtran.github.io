This app attempts to scrape the first 150 cars (of the chosen brand and type) that are sold on Marktplaats.
It provides a simple example of how unstructured data can be extracted and visualised in order to 
gather information. 
<br/><br/>
The app bears no malicious intent. It serves educational purposes ([Novalinq academy](https://www.novalinq.nl/academy){:target="_blank"}) 
and certain individuals' burning passion for cars.

### info

* the Marktplaats HTML layout has been adjusted multiple times, we never know when is the next. Therefore, this app can die at anytime
* due to complications from the current layout, some pre-scraping was done with selenium
* it is possible to sort & filter the datatable, click a record to see where it stands, remove car, change the plot type (see below)
* deployed in RShiny
* not mobile-compatible
